Known for work in wave mechanics. First studied and got a degree in history before becoming interested in science.

Won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1929 for his work in wave mechanics. His theory stated that all moving particles have an associated wave. This matter-wave duality is described by:

### 1894-1966: Georges Lemaitre
Completed PhD at MIT after serving in WWI with the Belgian army.

Known for being the first to derive the expanding universe from Einstein's General Relativity (FLRW metric) and giving the first approximation of the Hubble constant in 1927. After initially being an unpopular idea, Hubble's data showing a red shift of galaxies (indicating moving away), Lemaitre proposed the "primeval atom" ie. the Big Bang theory, where Lemaitre postulated that the current expanding universe dawned from a single point.

He was an early user of computers and took advantage of Vannevar Bush's differential analyzer at MIT.

### 1964: Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson
Setup experiement in 1964 with 20-foot horn shapped antenna to analyze the signals coming from between galaxies. The antenna had been originally constructed to research the collection and amplification radio signals for long distance transmission, but made obsolete with the launch of communication satellites. When Penzias and Wilson began to experiement with the antenna, they encountered a degree of microwave noise in all directions. They attempted moved the antenna to account for "urban interference" from New York city and cleaned/protected the antenna from pigeon droppings.

It wasn't until they heard of theory by Princeton's Robert Dicke that they were able to identify the source of the noise. Dicke predicted that if the Big Bang had occured, there would be low level radiation found througout the universe. Penzias and Wilson won the Nobel Prize in physics in 1978 for the discovery of Cosmic Microwave Background radition.
### 1953: Andrew Wiles 
In 1995, he finished proving Fermat's last theorem after almost a decade of work on the subject. His proof involved the use of modular forms, elliptic curves and galois representations. The famous problem from 1637 states that for three different integers, a, b and c, there is no soultion to the equation:

where n is greater than 2.
